# How to Use This Scaffold

This guide walks you through setting up a new project using LLM-DocKit.

## Quick Start (5 Minutes)

### 1. Fork or Clone This Repository

**Linux/macOS/Git Bash:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LLM-DocKit.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
rm -rf .git
git init
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/LLM-DocKit.git my-new-project
cd my-new-project
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .git
git init
```

### 2. Replace Project Name Placeholders

Search and replace the following placeholders throughout all files:

| Placeholder | Replace With | Where |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| `<PROJECT_NAME>` | Your actual project name | All documentation files |
| `<CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE>` | Language for LLM conversations (e.g., Spanish, English) | [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md) |
| `<YYYY-MM-DD>` | Current date in ISO format | [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md), [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) |

**Quick command (Linux with GNU sed)**:
```bash
# Replace all placeholders at once
find . -type f -name "*.md" -exec sed -i \
  -e 's/<PROJECT_NAME>/YourProjectName/g' \
  -e 's/<CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE>/Spanish/g' \
  -e "s/<YYYY-MM-DD>/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/g" {} +
```

**macOS (BSD sed requires empty string after -i)**:
```bash
# Replace all placeholders at once
find . -type f -name "*.md" -exec sed -i '' \
  -e 's/<PROJECT_NAME>/YourProjectName/g' \
  -e 's/<CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE>/Spanish/g' \
  -e "s/<YYYY-MM-DD>/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)/g" {} +
```

**Windows (PowerShell)**:
```powershell
# Replace all placeholders at once
$projectName = "YourProjectName"
$language = "Spanish"
$today = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"

Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Filter *.md | ForEach-Object {
    (Get-Content $_.FullName -Encoding UTF8) `
        -replace '<PROJECT_NAME>', $projectName `
        -replace '<CONVERSATION_LANGUAGE>', $language `
        -replace '<YYYY-MM-DD>', $today |
    Set-Content $_.FullName -Encoding UTF8
}
```

### 3. Customize Core Documentation

Edit these files with your project details:

#### [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
- **Vision**: What problem are you solving?
- **Objectives**: What are you building?
- **Stakeholders**: Who owns this?
- **Architecture**: High-level design

#### [docs/STRUCTURE.md](docs/STRUCTURE.md)
- Document your actual folder structure
- Explain naming conventions
- Add onboarding notes

#### [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md)
- Review all rules and adapt to your workflow
- Update the "Current Focus" section
- Remove sections that don't apply

### 4. Initialize Your Project Structure

Choose what you need:

**For a web application:**
```bash
# Keep: src/, tests/, .github/
# Remove: scripts/ (unless you need build scripts)
rm -rf scripts/
```

**For infrastructure/DevOps:**
```bash
# Keep: scripts/, tests/
# Remove: src/ (or rename to infrastructure/)
rm -rf src/
```

**For a library/package:**
```bash
# Keep: src/, tests/, .github/
# Remove: scripts/ (or use for build tools)
```

**For CLI tools:**
```bash
# Keep: src/, scripts/, tests/
# Rename: src/ to cli/ or bin/
mv src/ cli/
```

### 5. Start Your First LLM Session

1. Share [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md) with your LLM
2. Ask it to read [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
3. Start working on your first feature
4. **Important**: Ensure the LLM updates [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) and [docs/llm/HISTORY.md](docs/llm/HISTORY.md) after every change

## Detailed Customization

### Update README.md
Replace the generic content in [README.md](README.md) with:
- Project description
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- Contribution guidelines

### Configure Versioning
Edit [docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md](docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md):
- Define where versions live in your project (e.g., `package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, script headers)
- Adapt the version bump rules to your workflow
- Add examples specific to your tech stack

### Set Up GitHub Templates (Optional)
If using GitHub, customize:
- [.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)
- [.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md)
- Add more issue templates as needed (feature requests, documentation, etc.)

### Create Your First Runbook
Add operational procedures to [docs/operations/](docs/operations/):
- Deployment steps
- Rollback procedures
- Incident response
- Backup/restore processes

## Workflow Integration

### Working with LLMs

**Before each session:**
1. LLM reads [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md)
2. LLM checks [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) for current state
3. LLM reviews [docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md](docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md) if touching versioned files

**After each session:**
1. LLM updates [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) with new status
2. LLM appends to [docs/llm/HISTORY.md](docs/llm/HISTORY.md) with format:
   ```
   YYYY-MM-DD - <LLM_NAME> - <Summary> - Files: [list] - Version impact: <yes/no>
   ```
3. LLM provides commit info in response

### Version Management

When bumping versions:
1. Consult [docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md](docs/VERSIONING_RULES.md)
2. Update all related files in the same component
3. Document in [docs/llm/HISTORY.md](docs/llm/HISTORY.md)
4. Update [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) "Current Versions" section

### Documentation Maintenance

Keep these files synchronized:
- [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md) "Current Focus" <-> [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) "Current Status"
- [docs/STRUCTURE.md](docs/STRUCTURE.md) <-> actual folder structure
- [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) <-> architecture reality

```bash
# Structure
src/
  frontend/  # React components
  backend/   # Node.js API

```

## Maintenance Tips

### Regular Updates
- Review [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) at the start of each day/session
- Archive old [docs/llm/HISTORY.md](docs/llm/HISTORY.md) entries yearly (keep last 12 months visible)
- Update [docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md](docs/PROJECT_CONTEXT.md) when architecture changes

### Multi-LLM Collaboration
- Different LLMs can work on the same project by following the handoff protocol
- [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) is the single source of truth for current state
- "Do Not Touch" section prevents conflicts

### Human + LLM Collaboration
- Humans should also update [docs/llm/HANDOFF.md](docs/llm/HANDOFF.md) and [docs/llm/HISTORY.md](docs/llm/HISTORY.md)
- Use the same commit message format for consistency
- Review LLM changes before committing

## Troubleshooting

**Q: LLM doesn't follow the rules**
- Ensure [LLM_START_HERE.md](LLM_START_HERE.md) is shared at the beginning of every session
- Explicitly remind the LLM to update HANDOFF and HISTORY
- Check if rules are marked as "non-negotiable"

**Q: Documentation gets out of sync**
- Set up a pre-commit hook to check HANDOFF/HISTORY have recent dates
- Make documentation updates part of your definition of "done"

**Q: Too much history in HISTORY.md**
- Archive entries older than 12 months to `docs/llm/HISTORY_ARCHIVE_<YEAR>.md`
- Keep recent history visible for context

**Q: Multiple people/LLMs editing at once**
- Use Git branches for parallel work
- Merge HANDOFF.md carefully, keeping the most recent "Current Status"
- Append all HISTORY.md entries chronologically

## Next Steps
